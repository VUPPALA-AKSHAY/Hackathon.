# 🎯 AI-Powered Code Debugger

## 🚀 Project Description
Welcome to the **AI-Powered Code Debugger**! This project leverages **Artificial Intelligence** to automatically **detect** errors in your code and provide **corrected versions**. It aims to enhance the coding experience by offering quick fixes and improving code quality.

The AI system uses advanced techniques to identify and correct common coding errors, such as syntax mistakes, logical issues, and runtime bugs. This tool is designed for developers who want a smarter, faster way to debug their code.

In addition, the project also generates a **colorful and detailed README** that explains the corrected code, making it easy for users to understand what has been fixed.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Error Detection**: Automatically detects syntax, logical, and runtime errors in your code.
- **Code Correction**: Suggests fixes and provides the corrected version of your code.
- **Colorful README Generation**: Automatically generates a **colorful README** that explains the code with easy-to-read formatting and styling.
- **AI-Driven**: Powered by AI algorithms to enhance debugging accuracy.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **JavaScript (Node.js)**
- **AI/ML Algorithms** for error detection and correction
- **Markdown** for colorful README generation

## 🔄 How It Works
The AI-Powered Code Debugger analyzes the code, identifies errors, and provides solutions in real-time. After correcting the code, it generates a visually appealing README that explains the changes in a structured and easy-to-understand format.

## 🌱 Project Vision
This project aims to improve the efficiency of developers by reducing time spent on manual debugging, making the process of error detection and correction more automated and user-friendly.
